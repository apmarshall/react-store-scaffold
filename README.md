# React Store Scaffold

This project is based on the scaffolding in the book ReactJS Blueprints by Sven A. Robbestad. It has been updated, as needed, for more recent versions of Babel and ReactJS. It will also evolve with our usage.

For this project, we are using:
- Reflux as a Flux implementation
- A basic JSON database of products

Please note: Robbestad's original instructions use Twitter Bootstrap to provide a front end framework for styling. I have opted not to use bootstrap. In early versions of this, bootstrap stubs will still be in the code, which means many things will not work because there will be missing components. As this project develops, those components will be rebuilt using my preferred CSS library, Tailwind.
